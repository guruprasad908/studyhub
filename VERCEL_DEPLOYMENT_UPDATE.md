# Updating StudyHub on Vercel

Your updated StudyHub application has been successfully pushed to GitHub. Now you can update your Vercel deployment with these improvements.

## Option 1: Automatic Deployment (If Vercel is connected to GitHub)

If your Vercel project is already connected to your GitHub repository, the deployment should happen automatically. You can check the status in your Vercel dashboard.

## Option 2: Manual Deployment

If you need to manually trigger a deployment, follow these steps:

1. Go to your [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your StudyHub project
3. Click on "Deployments" tab
4. Click "New Deployment" or "Redeploy"
5. Select the `main` branch
6. Click "Deploy"

## Environment Variables

Make sure your Vercel project has the required environment variables:

1. In your Vercel Dashboard, go to your project
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Click on "Environment Variables" in the sidebar
4. Ensure you have these variables set:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` = your Supabase project URL
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = your Supabase anon key

If you're using demo mode, you can use placeholder values, but for production use, you'll need real Supabase credentials.
